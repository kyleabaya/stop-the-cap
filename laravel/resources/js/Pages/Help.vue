                Join a Lobby
                If you have a game code, enter it in the "Join Lobby" section.
                Wait for the game to begin once all players are ready.
                </p>
                <h2>üéÆHow to Play</h2> 
                <p>
                Each round, players will be given a unique prompt.
                Your goal is to blend in with the group by answering to the best of your ability (or lying if you are the imposter).
                Pay attention to other players and try to spot any inconsistencies!

                At the end of the round, players vote on who they think is "faking it" or not following the prompt. 
                Each imposter plays for 3 rounds if they remain uncaught, then a new imposter is assigned and they start with a new three rounds. 
                As soon as the imposter is caught, points are given and a new imposter is assigned.
                The player with the most votes is revealed, and points are awarded.
                </p>

                <h2>üèÜ Winning the Game</h2>
                <p>
                Players earn points by correctly guessing the imposter or fooling others into thinking they are telling the truth.
                The game continues for multiple rounds, with different prompts each time. 
                The player with the highest score at the end wins!</p>
